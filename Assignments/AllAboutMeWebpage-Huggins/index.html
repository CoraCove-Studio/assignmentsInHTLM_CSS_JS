    <h2>My Professional Interest</h2>
    <p>Before I began my college career into Wake Technical Community College's Simulation and Game Development program
        I was really unsure of what exactly I was interested in doing in the gaming industry. I know that I wanted to express
        myself in some creative outlet that seemed meaningful because I've always had a vision but never really a medium
        to do so. Growing up I played a few games like Lego games and the Harry Potter games, but I always looked out in the 
        electronics section at the store with such a longing to pick up World of Warcraft when it first game out. Or God of War 
        when I saw the first trailer for the second game. There was a story that could be told that wasn't in a book or movie,
        a story that could be experienced. This first semester for me was really grounding because I never really thought
        of having a chance of doing something that really stretched that itch to tell the tales of my daydreams and thoughts. 
    </p>
    <p>At first my thought ran to actually being the coder for these webs of stories I wanted to spin, and honestly there
        is an encouragement to do so with the possible higher amount of income granted to coders or programmers. And how much
        I can and do enjoy coding, I thrive to build and grow into this new age of gameplay. I want to tell stories that put
        you in the shoes of the characters and experience the world in the setting, the realm, the sounds and the mechanics. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The ability to bring forth an experience to me is a mark you can leave upon the world just as important as any building, song,
        or other piece of artwork. I don't have any singular interest in the field, just as long as I can say I was part of the experience.
        Whether it was an experience that came from my own creation, or me helping someone bringing theirs to life, I just want to thrive
        in that process of creation. Whatever I can do to make that experience more real to the person who will travel that thrill to me
        is better than anything else I can do. It's an actual memory. Its a new to tell a tale. An experience of that level is something 
        you don't forget. Take Legend of Zelda for example, a game that existed in the wake of Nintendo's creation and they are still
        able to bring about a new experience for everyone, of all ages, those who have had the chance to walk with them before to those 
        who are just getting the chance to. The music, the mechanics, the jokes, the freedom, the tale as old as time of good conquering evil
        unified us all who play that style of game with one similar aspect, the creators gave us an experience. So whereever or however I 
        can bring that type of enjoyment to the world I'd do so. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My favorite interests within the game development industry are story building, world building, foley artistry, and how general 
        mechanics work. I love breaking apart a game and think how well other mechanics would with a particular one. And I'm constantly
        coming up with ideas for characters while listening to music, which leads me to think how I'd pose that character in artwork,
        which lends itself to what sort of world that character would play in. World building for me is the equivilant of those 3AM
        YouTube deep dives people find themselves on. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I can't think of an exact job I'd want to do in the industry persay, as long as I get to create something and work with my hands.
        I've never been the type who is satisfied with sitting at a desk and just typing away at something. I need to know how things work,
        in a hands on sense, so I can make it work better for me. That being said, I want to work on passion projects that might further
        develop what I truly enjoy doing, but as of right now I'm digging the whole gig. I've always liked picking up new skills, and I 
        feel like this is a great industry to be a jack of all trades in.

    <h4>Why did D&D make the top of my list?</h4>
    <p>
        For me Dungeons & Dragons(D&D) has always been a pivotal point in my life. I started playing D&D when I was in high school, which was 2007-2011. 
        That was still during 4th edition, but Pathfinder 1E was pretty new and Paizo was just stretching their legs. For me, D&D was my first experience with
        creating in a game where the whole system revolved around what mechanics the players go to use. There was roleplay, combat, and world building all in one.
        If you think of it, you can make it, you can play it, you can live it, dream it, and breath some much life into it. D&D is where I learned how to speak 
        publicly, where I learned social structure. I learned what actually makes a game fun, what play styles I enjoy doing, exploring and building upon. 
        I've made friends within the whole roleplaying community, and with how big it is now, there is so much being created for the system. So many people make
        content to the equivalent of mods for the system where it's just additional content. For me, D&D is the perfect example of what a video game should 
        want itself to be. The mechanics exist and the player gets to discover them. D&D gives players a sense of wonder and creative liberty that comes as a 
        refreshing experience. And that's the thing. D&D provides an experience, one that is lived through and can be passed on like how human ancestory used 
        to share stories. It's a game of the imagination and stretches that creative liberty, and can only get better the more you play and the more you 
        enjoy the experience.
