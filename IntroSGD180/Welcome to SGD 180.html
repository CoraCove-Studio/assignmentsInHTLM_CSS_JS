        <p>Welcome to SGD 180 - Introduction to HTML. In this course you will be introduced to
            HTML5 (Hyper Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascade Style Sheets), and JavaScript.</p> <!--The text between <p> and </p> describes a paragraph-->

<br /> <!-- You can utilize line breaks to add spaces between exposed elements (e.g. header, paragrapgh, img, etc) -->

        <h2> Getting Started: </h2>
        <p> It is possible to write HTML, CSS and js in any text editor (e.g. Notepad, Text Edit), becuase a compiler is not necessary. 
            However, it is recommended to utilize text editors with intellisense (auto complete for code) and syntax formatting to improve workflow.
            Notepad++, Komodo Edit, and Visual Studio Code are free IDE's that provide the ability to utilize workflow tools.

            Creating an .html document is as easy as 1 ... 2
            <!-- This is an ordered list, or bullet pointed list -->
            <!-- <ol> specifies ordered list -->
            <!-- <li> specifies the list item text -->
            <!-- It is not necessary to put a line break before or after a list. The format specifier has that functionality built in -->
            <ol>
                <li>Open any text editor</li>
                <li>Give the document the .html extension when saving</li>
            </ol>

            It is also recommended to create a folder to house all of the elements of your web application. 
            When linking elements (e.g. images, audio, etc) in your code, the .html document will search the path, for said elements, that the document is saved in.
            When you submit your assignments, you will submit the entire working folder.

        <h2> Resources: </h2>
        <p> Before we can get to game code, we must start with the basics. For the first portion of this course, 
			the website: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"> w3schools.com </a> can provide additional assistance for introductory HTML, CSS and Javscript. 
			Also, any webpage can be a use case resource,             just by viewing its source. <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000746.htm" target="_blank"> see this link </a><br />
<br />      The lecture .html documents, provided to you, are not only webpages. If you open up the .html file in a text editor, you will find that the lecture is 
            just one big code example. Pay close attention to the comments...
